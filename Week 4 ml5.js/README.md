### Machine Learning

[ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/)

[ML5 Beginners Guide](https://thecodingtrain.com/learning/ml5/index.html) by Dan Shiffman on the coding train. His first video is a good inroduciton. I did Pose Estimation with PoseNet #7.1, then Train Your Own Neural Network #6.1 which gave me a good background on how both worked. Going through all the videos in sections 6 and 7 will give you a lot of tools for using machine learning in your work. But have a look through the videos and see what interests you.

[PoseNet pose estimation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/posenet-pose-estimation/). This article has the background to how it works, and goes through intergrating it into a python project.
