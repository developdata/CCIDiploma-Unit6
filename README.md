# Unit 6 - Creative Practice: Computational Environments
This repository contains information and code for the Computational Environments unit for the Diploma in Creative Computing.

The aim of this unit is to build on your experience of using the creative computing tools and techniques you have developed to produce interactive experience and consider the potential of computational space.

## Assessment
All assessment information will be on the Moodle page for the unit.

## Care
In this unit you will be exploring care and computational environments.

## Creative
In this section I've put links to work that you have told me about or that I have found. Let me know if you find anything interesting you'd like to share and I'll add it.

I went to an [Urban Data Talks Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/urban-data-talks/) which had three interesting talks on projects that used data. I found Claire Fram's talk on an Arup project which uses agent based modelling really intersting. She's has a blog post about it called [Net zero and agent based modelling](https://medium.com/arupcitymodelling/net-zero-and-agent-based-modelling-7ee090f42a4d)
 which is worth a read. 

 A friend told me about the [project art works](https://projectartworks.org/) a collective of neurodiverse artitsts and actavists. She'd been to one of their workshops and on their site they say: "Our programmes evolve through creative practice and radiate out to awareness raising in the cultural and care sectors, promoting more diverse representation in programming and relevancy for audiences." I thought the link to care is interesting.

[Squid Soup](https://www.squidsoup.org/)
Matt sent this link, really nice work they create interactive installations with light and sound.

Matt also sent a link to [Cinimod Studio, and innovation design studio in London](https://www.cinimodstudio.com/). Their showreel is worth a look. Really nice interactive work using within environments.

[Makeflix](https://www.makeflix.org/)
I went to a workshop run by Makeflix at MozFest on creative repair. It is a creative community encouraging respect for materials, processes adn people.

[gather town](https://gather.town) I'm not sure if I should add it to this section, someone told me about this last week and I thought it was interesting to have a platform where you could talk together and decide where you want to be.

## Extra Code
There's a folder called extra code where I've added code that doens't fit into a particular week. 

[Wellcome Trust API](https://developers.wellcomecollection.org/)
I saw this at Mozfest, you can access all the images in the Wellcome Trust library. They are mainly medical. In the extra code folder I've made an html file that uses the API to bring in images. You can filter by type and colour, you can see it in the requets string. They have a good gitHub page with links to python and JavaScript code.

## Technical Tutorials
I've added here online tutorials that I've found useful that don't relate to a particular workshop. 

### Blender
Blender is a really useful application to learn. It is a free and open source 3D software that lets you model, animate, render etc. I found it really useful making animated models that I could import into Unity with the rigging, where I could trigger individual bits of the animation.

[Blender Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPrnSACiTJ4)
This is where I started with learning blender. It's a great tutorial that goes through making a donut and a cup of coffee. I went through about half of the tutorial and it got me where I needed to be to create models for a VR project.

[Creating a low poly tree in Blender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wB0VgyN8tOw)

[Going from Blender to Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31fb5efsM4&list=PLA6Gf0nq2Gh4AVFeqUL7xUfoxASM6izh5) This is a great playlist and one that helped me a lot. You build a bear in Blender, then rig and animate it. The animation is exported with the bear so you can bring it into Unity and play the animations individualy.

### Unity
I'll be using Unity again to make some content for research I'm doing, so I've been doing some tutorials to get back into it, and have found some nice ones online.

This is a good introduction to [creating particles with the visual effects graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwWL5IY4Lqs), it leads up to this tutorial where you can [manipulate the particles in VR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyMF2Wo1awo). I haven't tried the last one yet, but it looks good.

### Web
This is an interesting list of ways to [genratate SVG's](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/03/svg-generators/?ref=sidebar)

## Week One: Introduction to the unit
This weeks workshop is an introduction to the unit and to the theme of care. The Moodle page for the unit contains information about the workshop, including homework and links. The [Week One folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%20One%20Introduction) in this repository contains a list of references for the week.

## Week Two: Web Audio with the Web Audio API
The aim of this workshop is to gain a better understanding of the audio capabilities of the web, and to think about how you can use audio in your projects. By the end of the workshop you should understand the capabilities of the Web Audio API and be able to add audio to a web page through audio files, streaming audio and an Oscillator. You can find the references and code for the workshop in the [Week Two folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%20Two%20Audio).

## Week Three: JavaScript
The aim of this workshop is to go through some of the more advanced JavaScript concepts and how JavaScript works. These will be callbacks, promises, async/await, modules and classes. I will alos go through API's. This should help you get a better understanding of how JavaScript works and should help when you are writing your own code and looking at other peoples. By the end of the workshop you should be able to use async/await to input a file, create and implement a module and a class, and use an API to get data from an external source.

 You can find the references and code for the workshop in the [Week 3 folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%203%20JavaScript)

 ## Week Four: ML5.js
 The aim of this workshop is to get you comfortable using machine learning in a web based project using ML5.js. By the end of the workshop you should have built some example projects that can be used as a reference if you use ML5.js in your projects.

 You can find the references and code for the workshop in the [Week 4 folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%204%20ml5.js)

 ## Week Five: Participatory Design
 This weeks workshop is a bit different as you will be sharing your work with each other. There is also a video to watch that introduces particpatory design. In the [week five folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%205%20Participatory%20design) you can find links for participatory design resources.

  ## Week Six: Participatory Design
  This week will be a practical workshop where you will be facilitating and taking part in a particpatory design workshop. Useful resources to help you design a workshop can be found in the [week five folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%205%20Participatory%20design).

  ## Week Seven: Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
  The aim of this workshop is to understand the capabilities of the Arduino Nano 33 Ble Sense and to become comfortable with setting it up and sending data to and from a web page. Links to resources and code are in the [Week 7 folder](https://github.com/developdata/CCIDiploma-Unit6/tree/main/Week%207%20Arduino%20Nano%2033%20BLE%20Sense)

    ## Week Nine: Speculative Design
