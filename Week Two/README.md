# Week 2 - The Web Audio API
This folder contains the references and code for the Web Audio API workshop. There isn't a video on spatial audio, but I have inluded the code, so read through that, and look at the reference material so you get an understanding of the code.

## Starting a python server
You can create a simple server on your computer by starting a python server. In a terminal window, navigate to the project folder then type in the following to start the server
for python 2: 
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

for python 3: `python -m http.server 8500`

The number at the end is optional, it defines the port the server will run, which will be 8000 as default.

You don't need to restart the server when you make changes to a page, just refresh the browser window. You exit the server by typing CTRL or CMD + c in the terminal window.
