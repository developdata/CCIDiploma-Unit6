# Week 7 - Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense
This weeks workshop is an introduction to the Arduino Nano 33 BLE sense. I've put the code I go through in the video in this folder, along with a list of resourse I used when making the videos.

[Getting Started with p5.ble.js Using Arduino Nano 33 BLE](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/jingwen_zhu/getting-started-with-p5-ble-js-using-arduino-nano-33-ble-120ea6) This was the tutorial I went through to get started sending data to and from the nano and a web page. In the tutorial they use the online p5.js IDE so I have made a video to go through writing the code locally.
