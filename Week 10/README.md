# Week 10 - Environments
In this workshop Daniel Daniel Vera-Villalobos about his work and ran an exercise to reflect on the meaning of a common virtual space and multi-identity within a virtual environment, by composition of 3D objects and positional audio representing different concepts of home together in the same area. 

By Exploring the potential of re-configuration of external assets, the exercise experimented with the idea of a post-identity virtual home. Learning about the use of 3D models and audio on the web (A-frame) and asset preparation for web environments.

On this page are links to resources and information from the workshop.

You can view Daniel's works on the [Rarea studios website](https://rareastudio.com/), and view his dissertation [The promised land - dystopian home stories in the era of emotional capitalism ](https://rareastudio.com/pdfs/DanielAndresVeraVillalobos_Final_CHSdissertation.pdf)

## Assets
Below are links to sites where you can find assets for building 3D worlds

## Images
[HDRIHaven](https://hdrihaven.com/hdris/) has images that you can use as background in VR.

## A-Frame
You can [remix the glitch document that Daniel set up](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/cci-thehomeweshare)

The [A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/introduction/) is good, with an API that's pretty detailed.

## Audio
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is free, open source, cross-platform audio software

With [freesound](https://freesound.org/) you can download audio clips.

## 3D models

[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) is a site for models for 3D printing, but a lot of the models have .obj files that can be downloaded and converted to glTF

[Turbosquid](turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free) has some free models.
