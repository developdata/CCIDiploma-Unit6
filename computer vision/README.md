#Computer Vision
This folder contains resources connected to computer vision. The [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision) describes compter vision as:

> Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

## Books
[Image Processing and Computer Vision](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html)

## Examples
These are some examples of work that includes computer vision with different technologies.

[Computer vision examples by Kyle Mcdonald.github.io/cv-examples/](https://kylemcdonald.github.io/cv-examples/)(they didn't work for me in FireFox but did in Chrome).

A lot of the work in the [The Barbican Digital Revolution Exhibition Highlights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5Hi72Dwo0E) used computer vision.

This is the [Creative Machine Learning Experiments Showcase](https://medium.com/runwayml/creative-machine-learning-experiments-showcase-4cbdafa0ce42#ea31) from students on a post graduate module at NYU.

## Audio
[This project](https://github.com/chrislos/maxPosenet) uses posenet and Node.js to send data into MaxMSP.

[This project Wraps PoseNet inside electron and serves the detected parts via MaxAPI.](https://github.com/billythemusical/n4m-posenet-for-dummies/)

### 3D and VR/AR

[Paper Cubes, DIY Augmented Reality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arOEUVO1rIw), there's more information about the project in [this article](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/paper-cubes)

### Arduino
These projects use ml5.js with Arduino
[ml5.js image classifier with Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PiU4rZYOY2E)

These projects use computer vision and arduino, but not with ml5.js
[Clean Water AI](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/clean-water-ai/clean-water-ai-e40806?ref=tag&ref_id=computer%20vision&offset=7) uses computer vision to dangerous bacteria and particles.

### Libraries

With [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) you can create machine learning models for images (including streamed video), audio and poses.

[ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) is built on top of TensorFlow and allows you to create web based machine learning projects.

[handsfree.js](https://handsfree.js.org/#installing) is a JavaScript library for pose tracking.

[WebGazer.js](WebGazer.js) can be used for eye tracking, it works on Chrome browsers.

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is an open source library for computer vision. You can use a number of programming languages with it including python and C++, most of the tutorials I found were used Python. There is a version called [OpenCV.js](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d0a/tutorial_js_intro.html) for using JavaScript.
