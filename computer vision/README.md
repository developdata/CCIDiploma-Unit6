#Computer Vision
This folder contains resources connected to computer vision. The [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision) describes compter vision as:

> Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.

## Examples
These are some examples of work that includes computer vision with different technologies.

This is the [Creative Machine Learning Experiments Showcase](https://medium.com/runwayml/creative-machine-learning-experiments-showcase-4cbdafa0ce42#ea31) from students on a post graduate module at NYU.

## Audio
[This project](https://github.com/chrislos/maxPosenet) uses posenet and Node.js to send data into MaxMSP.

[This project Wraps PoseNet inside electron and serves the detected parts via MaxAPI.](https://github.com/billythemusical/n4m-posenet-for-dummies/)

### 3D and VR/AR

### Arduino
These projects use ml5.js with Arduino

These projects use computer vision and arduino, but not with ml5.js
[Clean Water AI](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/clean-water-ai/clean-water-ai-e40806?ref=tag&ref_id=computer%20vision&offset=7) uses computer vision to dangerous bacteria and particles.
