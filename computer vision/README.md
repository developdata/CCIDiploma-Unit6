#Computer Vision
This folder contains resources connected to computer vision. The [IBM website](https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision) describes compter vision as:

> Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs — and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand.
